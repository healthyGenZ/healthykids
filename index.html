        <h2>1. Parents - Think before introducing Tea or Coffee to kids</h2>
        <p>
            <b>Tea and coffee contain caffeine</b> which may affect <b>sleep quality, digestion and the nervous system</b>.
            Many adults experience acidity, heart palpitations and lack of deep sleep due to regular caffeine intake.Prevention is far easier than quitting later.

    <section class="card">
        <h2>2. If We Drink, How Can We Tell Kids Not To?</h2>
        <p>
            Parents can honestly explain that certain health information was not widely known earlier,
            and they developed the habit unknowingly. <b>Children understand honesty</b>.
            Open communication builds trust and helps them choose healthier habits.

        <h2>3. Lifetime Habit & Sugar Intake</h2>
        <p>
            <b>Early introduction to tea or coffee often turns into a lifetime habit</b>.
            These drinks usually include added sugar, increasing daily sugar intake.
            Reducing sugar later becomes difficult. 
			It is better to protect children from developing this habit early in life.

        <h2>4. Effects on Teeth & Nervous System</h2>
        <p>
            Tea and coffee may stain teeth and <b>contribute to dental concerns</b> over time.
            <b>Caffeine stimulates the nervous system, potentially affecting sleep patterns,
            focus and emotional balance  in children </b>.
